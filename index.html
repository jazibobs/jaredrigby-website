				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>I'm Jared Rigby, a Cheshire based web and applications developer. I love to write code which solves problems and firmly believe no task is too great given enough time and tea.</p>
				<p>I currently work for <a rel="nofollow" href ="http://www.thefreshuk.com/">The Fresh</a> in Manchester as a front-end web developer building, maintaining and updating a number of client websites.</p>
				<p>My humble site is powered by a Raspberry Pi which sits downstairs next to my router. It's a pretty neat piece of kit which I'm having a lot of fun developing on, plus I get to pretend to be a very important Linux system admin...</p>
				<p>It is the aim of this site to provide a stage for me to show you guys what I code in my spare time. So please take some time to check out my current <a href="http://www.jaredrigby.co.uk/projects/overview.html">projects</a> and the <a href="http://blog.jaredrigby.co.uk">blog</a>.
