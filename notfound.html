				<h1>Looks like we're lost...</h1>
				<p>I think we just broke the internet? Either you are searching for a page that does not exsist or I'm a terrible web admin who needs to fix his site.</p>
				<p>Anyway, all I can suggest is you either hit the back button on your browser or try starting again from the <a href="http:/www.jaredrigby.co.uk">home page</a>.</p>
				<p>Plus, if you could <a href="mailto:talk@jaredrigby.co.uk">contact me</a> and tell me where everything fell apart that'd be great too.</p>
