    		<h1>Digital Signage - The HLG Car Team</h1>
				<h2>DEVELOPMENT STATUS: ONGOING</h2>
				<div class="projtext">
					<p>HLG is a used car dealership in the Stockport area specialising in Mazda, Suzuki, Honda and Toyota.</p>
					<p>I am currently tasked with designing and implementing a "silent salesman" digital advertisement board to display cycling information about the company 24/7.</p>
					<p>I have proposed a Raspberry Pi based solution which will make effecient use of the space available by being highly portable and simple to set up.</p>
					<h3>Technologies used: html, css, javascript, jquery, raspberry pi, linux</h3>
